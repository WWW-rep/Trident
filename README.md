### Trident: A Universal Framework for Fine-Grained and Class-Incremental Unknown Traffic Detection

![avatar](./overview/frame.png)

## Introduction

Trident is a novel framework to detect unknown attack traffic in a fine-grained and incremental manner. It can realize known class classification, fine-grained unknown class detection, and incremental model updates (including sample increments and class increments). At a high level, Trident consists of three tightly coupled components named tSieve, tScissors, and tMagnifier. They are responsible for profiling traffic, determining outlier thresholds, and clustering respectively.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install torch
```

## Model Architecture

The AutoEncoder model architecture is stored in ./code/portrayer.py. 
```bash
portrayer.py
```

## Outlier Detection

The Extreme Value Theory (EVT) calculations is stored in ./code/evt.py. 
```bash
evt.py
```

## Demo Dataset

A demo of the demo dataset based on KDDCup 99 is stored in ./code/data_loader.py. 
```bash
data_loader.py
```

## Running

To perform this test code, enter the ./code/ folder, run with
```bash
python main_process.py
```
